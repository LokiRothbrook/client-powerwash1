 *     -   Defines the properties for each testimonial (id, name, role, content, etc.).
 *
 * 2.  **Testimonials Array (`testimonials`):**
 *     -   Replace the placeholder content with real quotes from your clients.
 *     -   Update the `name`, `role`, `content`, `rating`, `image` path, and
 *         optional `link` for each testimonial.
 *     -   Ensure `image` paths correspond to images in the `public/testimonials`
 *         directory.
 *
 * 3.  **Testimonials Section Content (`testimonialsSectionContent`):**
 *     -   Customize the `sectionTitle`, main `title`, `subtitle`, and the
 *         `trustIndicators` (e.g., number of happy clients, average rating).
